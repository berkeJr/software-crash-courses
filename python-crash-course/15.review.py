### Variables

x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))


x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

### Data Types

# Text Type:	str
# Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
# Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
# Mapping Type:	dict
# Set Types:	set, frozenset
# Boolean Type:	bool
# Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview


### Lists: ordered, changeable, indexed
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

# List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

# List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.


### Tuples: ordered and unchangeable.
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")     

# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

# Tuples are written with round brackets.


### Sets: unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

# A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.

# * Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.

### Loop Sets: 
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

for x in thisset:
  print(x)


### Dictionaries: ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)


thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"])


# Print the number of items in the dictionary:

print(len(thisdict))

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "electric": False,
  "year": 1964,
  "colors": ["red", "white", "blue"]
}


# Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

# A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.


### Ä°f-else
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")

### While
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1

### For Loops
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  if x == "banana":
    break

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    continue
  print(x) 

### Functions
def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")

my_function()


def my_function(fname):
  print(fname + " Refsnes")

my_function("Emil")
my_function("Tobias")
my_function("Linus")


def my_function(fname, lname):
  print(fname + " " + lname)

my_function("Emil", "Refsnes")


### Classes and Objects

# To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.

# All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.

# Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do 
# when the object is being created:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)


class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def myfunc(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()


### Inheritance

# Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.

# Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.

# Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.


### Create a class named Person
class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

# Use the Person class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:

x = Person("John", "Doe")
x.printname()

# Create a Child Class

# send the parent class as a parameter when creating the child class:
class Student(Person):
  pass  # no additional properties


# class Student(Person):
#   def __init__(self, fname, lname):
#     #add properties etc.
